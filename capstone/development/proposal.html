    <h1>Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Topic</h2>
    <p>My topic is a photo database/gallery of interesting or cool bikes throughout Davis to celebrate the city's long history with bikes. The target audience for my project will be adults, 18+.</p>
    <h2>Partner</h2>
    I don't plan to work with a partner.
    <h2>Features</h2>
    To make my project interactive and dynamic, I plan to have a feature where users can upload their own photos to the database to contribute. I might also consider implementing a 
    "liking" system where photos that are more liked are brought to the top.
    <h2>Vague Ideas</h2>
    I'm not sure yet about my project's layout, but I do want the photos to be the central focus. I'd like to have a gallery where photos have different sizes and fit together like puzzle pieces, but I don't know any easy way to actually implement that.
