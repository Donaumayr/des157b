        <h2>Building Community with Photography</h2>
        <p>Building Community With Photography is an article for educators about how photographs can be used to reveal a community’s strengths, build connections, and foster culture. The article is relevant to my own topic because I also want to use photos as a way for people in Davis to connect and appreciate its culture. I think the unique format of the work as an educational lesson was helpful in identifying ways to help people build an understanding of how to represent their community through photos. Overall, I took away from the article how important photos can be to showcase hidden aspects of a community, especially photos taken by local community members.</p>

        <h2>Empowering Communities through Photography</h2>
        <p>This article is about a project where communities were empowered through photography and given a “photovoice.” I thought this project had a close relation to how I wanted users to use my project as a way to share their own photos to create conversation and empower their identity as Davis residents. What stood out most to me about this project was how they used photos alongside text to augment a community’s voice and surpass language barriers, which I thought was extremely compelling. As for the credibility of the author, the project’s creator is a researcher at Dartmouth and so I trust their project. Overall, my primary takeaway from the project was the power people have if you place a camera in their hands and give them no boundaries to share their views. Photos can be really essential in documenting aspects of people’s lives that words can otherwise struggle to.</p>

        <h2>Photographing Interesting People in Your Community: A Guide to Taking Portraits</h2>
        <p>This article poses less of a direct relevance to my topic, but I thought it was an intriguing look into how to take compelling photos that can actually capture life in a community. I thought the content of the article could have applications to my own project in terms of informing users on how to better take photos that showcase their subject and reveal hidden details and depth. Given the article’s advice on photo-taking, I might consider including a disclaimer for users before they upload photos to my project with basic advice about how to take better photos. As for the background and credibility of the authors, they are all qualified writers from the New York TImes. Overall, my observations from reading the article were that just by taking the time to follow a couple simple rules, a photo can look miles better. In addition, I think it’s worth it to take photos with details that showcase aspects of community.</p>
