    <h1>Seal Selfie</h1>
    <p>
        The design aspect of the seal that I find most creative and symbolic is how the rings and spokes of its design reflect a bicycle's wheel. The simplistic, abstract map of Davis at the center of the seal is also a great detail that I didn't notice initially. Overall, I like how the seal is designed to encourage you to discover new features as you walk around it.
