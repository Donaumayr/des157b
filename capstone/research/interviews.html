        <h1>Target Audience Interviews</h1>
        <p>For my target audience interviews I contacted two students in Davis, Ethan and Raymond, who used bikes as their primary mode of transportation and that had experience with biking both more technically and recreationally. I hoped their extensive knowledge about biking could help provide me insights and context into what I should incorporate in my project. I conducted the interviews over zoom in a question-answer format and tried to let the interviewee freely speak about their biking experiences.
        </p>
        <p>I tried to frame my questions in a way just to get both me and the interviewee to think more critically about how biking plays a part in their life and dive deeper into the reasons behind why they bike and what they enjoy about it. Both of my interviewees had had an interest in biking since childhood, and appreciated the bikeability of both the UC Davis campus and the city as a whole. However, the terrain in Davis is largely flat and featureless, and I learned that for recreation it was preferable to drive to further and more mountainous areas nearer the bay to bike on trails or in places with more interesting scenery. However, though I found that students primarily only biked to commute in Davis, my interviewees both loved the culture and approach to the technical side of biking in the city. They mentioned that there are many locations in Davis that offer aftermarket parts and resources for fixing or maintaining bikes, and everyone they’ve met is very open and willing to help with any issues. 
        </p>
        <p>Overall, I was able to gain a much more informed and fleshed out perspective on the biking scene in Davis and how people use their bikes both in and outside of the city. One caveat that came up in my conversations was the prevalence of bike theft in Davis. One interviewee mentioned their bike being stolen despite multiple locks, and the general sentiment seemed to be that one needs to be extremely cautious with where they keep their bike at night. This led me to reflect on the potential side-effects of my project’s focus on capturing bikes in Davis, and consider potential alternative approaches, such as having users post about bike journeys they’ve recently taken.
